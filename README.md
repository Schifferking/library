# Library

This project consists in making a simple page with HTML/CSS with Javascript functionality that displays books on the page. It will also have a button to add a new book. Another feature is that each button will contain a button that allows the users to delete them. Finally, there will be another button that indicates that the user has read a book.

## Todo
- Add a way to update the read status (update element or remove value and attach slider to it)
- Create a div or something else when creating a book to look more professional
- Figure out a way to make all book cards buttons (preload and new ones) to be disabled or enabled.
- Maybe add more information to book cards (genre(s), publication year, standalone, etc.)
